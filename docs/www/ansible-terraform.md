# Deployment automation with Terraform & Ansible

Follow the steps in our 
[deployment automation](https://github.com/vectorizedio/deployment-automation)
project to deploy a Redpanda cluster on new or existing machines using Ansible
& Terraform. 

Ansible and Terraform play a key role in cloud automation. In our deployment
automation project, they allow you to bootstrap a brand new cluster in a matter
of minutes. Terraform is used to create and manage the underlying
infrastructure - such as VMs and firewalls - while Ansible playbooks
automatically install the latest version of Redpanda and configure all the
brokers for you.
